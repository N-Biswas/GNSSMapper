# GNSS
3D maps from GNSS data

Analysis: workbooks and scripts etc, where we are running experiments that inform the development and form a basis for any papers

Code: workflow and functions for the 3d mapping tool and simulation

Data: raw gnss data that we have collected

Map: an Ordnance Survey map of London which is used for the intersection detection. Note restrictions on access and copyright.

The code generates processed GNSS files and downloads supporting GNSS information such as sp3 (orbit) data and atmospheric data. These are assumed to be in a processedData folder. These are not part of the repository due to their size. They should be replicable from the raw data. Any key processedfiles are to be saved in our teams workspace.
